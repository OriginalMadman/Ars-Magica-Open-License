# The Ars Magica Open License - Complete Corpus in Markdown

This is a work-in-progress repository for machine-extracted, manually fixed markdowns of a complete set of the official Ars Magica Open Licensed material. These files should all be of a significantly better quality than most what has been released openly so far.

* In the **raw-md** folder, you'll find raw output dumps (from a longer workflow of re-OCR and AI-enhanced extraction and conversion) that are mostly in pretty good shape (3rd edition books excluded). However, expect tables, index and anything obscured by graphics to be broken.
* In the **wip** folder, is manual fixing work-in-progress. Whatever is here can be expected to be in much better shape than the raw markdowns.
* In the **done** folder, I expect to place finished Markdown files in tip-top shape.

The public is welcome to commit new and better versions (I mainly expect by manual edit and referencing the original works). Please make sure to provide information on what's been corrected, as well as any remaining issues. I'll try to quickly accept improvements to the repository after review (make my life easier, and it will be faster).

*Note: The excellent folks at redcap.org also have a project to provide these materials to the public on their wiki. However the project seems to have slow progress as of late, and at a less complete stage than this (redcap team is welcome to grab anything here to help of course).
